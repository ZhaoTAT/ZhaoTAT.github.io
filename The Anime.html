    <h2>The Japanese Anime</h2>
    <p>Japanese animation is the collective name of Japanese animation and manga.
     Japanese animation occupies an important position in the world with the
     innovation and interest of the plot. It is the leader of the world
     animation culture.</p>
    <p>Japan is a typical animation power. Its animation development model has
      distinctive national characteristics without losing innovation and
      attraction. Animation is an important industrial chain in Japan, with few
      rivals in the world. The development process of Japanese animation can be
      roughly divided into four stages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="germination.html">germination</a></li>
        <li><a href="exploration.html">exploration</a></li>
        <li><a href="maturity.html">maturity</a></li>
        <li><a href="refinement.html">refinement</a></li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Development history</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>1917-1945 - embryonic period</li>
      <li>1946-1973 - exploration period</li>
      <li>1974-1989 - mature period</li>
      <li>1990 till now - Refinement period</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The American Anime</h2>
    <p>The first American cartoon appeared in 1906 and experienced five stages
      of development until 2002. The development history of American animation
      is mainly divided into:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the pioneering stage</li>
    <li>the preliminary development stage</li>
    <li>the first prosperity stage</li>
    <li>the dormant stage</li>
    <li>prosperity stage</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The animation market in the United States is very mature and continues to
      improve itself with the rapid development of the film industry. In the
      history of world animation, American animation occupies an important
      position. It has always led the trend and development direction of world
      animation. It has a relatively mature commercial animation operation mode,
      many successful studios and world-class talent resources for animation
      design and production. So it is a well deserved film and animation
      kingdom.</p>

    <h2>The chinese Anime</h2>
    <p>Chinese animation originated in the 1920s. In 1926, China's first
      animated film, making a scene in the studio, opened a page in the
      history of Chinese animation. In the 1940s, <em>Wan brothers</em> created
      the first feature film of Chinese animation <em>Princess Iron Fan</em>,
      which was released to Southeast Asia and Japan. It was warmly welcomed
      by people and paved the way for Chinese animation to go international.
      Chinese animation has been incomparably brilliant, which also proves that
      Chinese animation has strength and artistic laws suitable for its
      development. Looking at the development of Chinese animation in recent
      decades, we can see that Chinese animation has always been committed to
      a road with its own characteristics.</p>
    <p>At present, most of China's animation works are for children (that's for
      a reason),In the United States and Japan, where the animation market is more
      developed, there are already many works for middle and high age groups.
      Animation can serve any age group and any field,Here are some of the famous
      anime in each year:</p>
