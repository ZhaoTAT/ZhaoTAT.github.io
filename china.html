For these times I have been to most of the attractions in Xian and I also have a great time eating the Rou jia Mo and Liang Pi.</p>

            <p>After I was born just about few days after my parents moved and lived in shenzhen, and about 2/3 of my life experience is about shenzhen. The reason why my family moved is because at that time shenzhen is one of the city that will have the state assisted and it is the only city that will be known as a high develop whthin these years.</p>

After Qin Shihuang unified Lingnan, it belonged to Guilin county.</p>

            <p>In 1201, the famous poet Wang Zhenggong wrote a poem "Guilin has the best landscape in the world". One of the reson I been their is also because of this poem, I want to see how beautiful Guilin is and the famous osmanthus fragrans beside its river. </p>

            <h2>History of china!</h2>

            <p>China has a long history, It has a history of more than 5000 years since Heluo ancient country (the embryo of civilization). It is generally believed that there are two direct sources of Chinese civilization, namely, the Yellow River civilization and the Yangtze River civilization.</p>

            <p> Chinese civilization is mainly the fruit of the exchange and sublimation of these two regional civilizations. Some historians believe that in the history of human civilization, "historical era" The definition of "prehistoric era" is that the period before the emergence of characters is called "prehistoric era".</p>

            <p>In prehistoric times, the chaos, Suiren, Fuxi, Shennong (Emperor Yan) and Huangdi (Xuanyuan) were honored as the cultural ancestors of the Chinese nation.</p>

            <p>About 2070 BC, China's earliest country, the Xia Dynasty, appeared. The Eastern Zhou Dynasty promoted the development of productive forces and social reform, and formed a situation of contention among a hundred schools of thought.</p>

            <p> In 221 BC, Qin Shihuang established the first unified autocratic centralized empire in Chinese history - Qin Dynasty, and the Western Han Dynasty further consolidated and developed the situation of great unification. </p>

            <p>During the Three Kingdoms, the two Jin Dynasties and the southern and Northern Dynasties, China fell into a situation of separation and separatism. During the period of five arbitrary regimes, the trend of foreign integration in China was strengthened, and many nationalities gradually gathered in the conflict of divided regimes.</p>

            <p>During the Sui and Tang Dynasties, the central government had closer ties with the frontier ethnic minorities, with economic prosperity and high development of science, technology and culture. During the song and Yuan Dynasties, multiculturalism collided and blended, and the economy, science and technology developed to a new height.</p>

            <p> In the heyday of the Ming Dynasty, social economy developed highly, and capitalism sprouted in Jiangnan at the end of the Ming Dynasty.In the mid-19th century, after the Opium War, China began to become a semi colonial and semi feudal society.</p>

            <p> The 1911 Revolution overthrew the monarchy and established the Republic. After Yuan Shikai's death, China entered a chaotic period of warlord separatism. After the national revolution, the agrarian revolution, the war of resistance against Japan and the war of liberation, the people's Republic of China was finally established in 1949. </p>

            <p>And the Cultural Revolution from <time datetime="1966">1966</time> to <time datetime="1976">1976</time>. After <time datetime="1978">1978</time>, China began to implement the policy of reform and opening up, and China's economy developed rapidly. In <time datetime="2011">2011</time>, China surpassed Japan to become the second largest economy in the world.</p>

            <p>Sun Yat Sen once said, "China not only has many food inventions, but also the beauty of cooking methods is beyond the reach of all countries, and the Chinese people's eating habits are still in line with academic hygiene, which is especially beyond the reach of ordinary people in all countries.</p>

            <p>" I'm afraid only the Chinese can raise food into culture and even form a unique national character and philosophical thought. China is the country with the longest "food culture". Long ago, we had the concept of "etiquette and music culture begins with food" and "food is the God of the people", which then included many cultures such as skills, nutrition and etiquette.</p>

            <p>Only in dishes, we formed the art of "viewing color, tasting aroma, tasting taste and appreciating shape", which can be described as broad and profound.</p>
