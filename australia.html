        <h2>Intro</h2>

        <p>Aboriginal Australians arrived on the continent at least 60,000 years ago and developed complex hunter-gatherer societies and oral histories.</p>

        <p>Dutch navigators led by Abel Tasman were the first Europeans to land in Australia in <time datetime="1606">1606</time>, and they mapped the western and northern coasts.</p>

        <p>They named the continent New Holland but made no attempts to permanently settle it. In <time datetime="1770">1770</time>, English captain James Cook sailed to the east coast of Australia, named it New South Wales, and claimed it for Great Britain.</p>

        <p>In the early <time datetime="2000">2000s</time>, Australian politics became unstable with frequent attempts to oust party leaders, including five changes of prime minister between <time datetime="2010">2010</time> and <time datetime="2018">2018</time>. As a result, both major parties instituted rules to make it harder to remove a party leader.</p>

          <p>This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries.</p>

          <p>When available, official lengths published by national statistical agencies are used. Because surveying methods may differ, country border

          <h3>Environment</h3>

          The reason that causes of environmental problems in Australia:

            <ul>
      <li>soil erosion from overgrazing</li>
      <li>deforestation</li>
      <li>industrial development</li>
      <li>urbanization</li>
      <li>poor farming practices</li>
            </ul>
         <div class="box">
          <p>limited natural freshwater resources, soil salinity rising due to the use of poor quality water, drought, desertification; clearing for agricultural purposes threatens</p>

          <p>the natural habitat of many unique animal and plant species; disruption of the fragile ecosystem has resulted in significant floral extinctions.</p>

          <p>the Great Barrier Reef off the northeast coast, the largest coral reef in the world, is threatened by increased shipping and its popularity as a tourist site, overfishing, pollution, and invasive species are also problems</p>
