    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>Aboriginal Australians arrived on the continent at least <em>60,000</em> years ago
       and developed complex hunter-gatherer societies and oral histories. </p>
    <p>Dutch navigators led by <strong>Abel Tasman</strong> were the first Europeans to land in
       Australia in <em>1606</em>, and they mapped the western and northern coasts. </P>
    <p>They named the continent New Holland but made no attempts to permanently
       settle it. In <em>1770</em>, English captain <strong>James Cook</strong> sailed to the east coast
       of Australia, named it New South Wales, and claimed it for Great Britain.

         <h3>Land Boundaries</h3>

         <p>total: 0 km</p>

         <p>This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the
            individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries. </p>
         <p>When available, official lengths published by national statistical agencies
            are used. Because surveying methods may differ, country border lengths
            reported by contiguous countries may differ.</p>

        <h3>Environment</h3>

        <p>soil erosion from overgrazing, deforestation, industrial development,
           urbanization, and poor farming practices.</p>
        <p>limited natural freshwater resources, soil salinity rising due to the
           use of poor quality water, drought, desertification; clearing for agricultural purposes threatens</p>
        <p>the natural habitat of many unique animal and plant species; disruption
           of the fragile ecosystem has resulted in significant floral extinctions.</p>
        <p>the Great Barrier Reef off the northeast coast, the largest coral reef
           in the world, is threatened by increased shipping and its popularity
           as a tourist site, overfishing, pollution, and invasive species are
           also problems</p>

     <h3>Population</h3>
        <p>25,809,973 (July 2021 est.)</p>

        <p>The total population presents one overall measure of the potential
          impact of the country on the world and within its region. Note: Starting
          with the <em>1993</em> Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African)
          have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>

        <p>The Realigion of Australia:

          <ul>
            <li>Protestant 23.1%</li>
            <li>Roman Catholic 22.6%</li>
            <li>Christian 4.2%</li>
            <li>Muslim 2.6%</li>
            <li>Buddhist 2.4%</li>
            <li>Orthodox 2.3%</li>
          </ul>

        <p>population is primarily located on the periphery, with the highest
           concentration of people residing in the east and southeast. a secondary
           population center is located in and around Perth in the west</p>
        <p>of the States and Territories, New South Wales has, by far, the largest
           population. the interior, or <strong>"outback"</strong>, has a very sparse population.</p>
