            <p>Shenzhen is not the "first" Special Economic Zone, but the "first batch" of special economic zones. In 1979, the central government agreed to pilot run export special zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou of Guangdong Province and Xiamen of Fujian Province.</p>

            <p>Shenzhen was originally just a fishing village. Due to the needs of reform and opening up, Bao'an county was included and renamed Shenzhen in January 1979. </p>

            <p>Shenzhen is a pilot area, so many reform policies were first settled in Shenzhen, and Shenzhen has therefore become the "bridgehead" of reform and opening up. The development history of Shenzhen is the development history of reform and opening up. He has witnessed all the processes of reform and opening up, which is equivalent to the epitome of reform and opening up.</p>

            <p>Shenzhen plays a leading role in the whole country. Therefore, Shenzhen has not only made drastic reforms, but also carefully implemented preferential policies, so it has created a remarkable "Shenzhen speed", known as "China's Silicon Valley".</p>
